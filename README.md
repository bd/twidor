very limited testing and is not yest stable.

## Roadmap

The current release includes only one keyboard layout, the [Backspice keymap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexBravo/Twiddler/master/Backspice2%20cheat%20sheet.txt).

In a future release, Twidor will be able to load other keymaps.
This will include the capability to read keymaps in the CSV format exported from
the[official [twidler layout editor](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml).

To generate a keymap suitable for input, one may:

* open https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml,
* select 'Edit Configuration' for a given configuration file,
* with the configuration file open, select Export, and then CSV.
* download the CSV file, and change the filename to keymap.txt, and
* place keymap.txt in the same direcory as the Twidor java .class files.
