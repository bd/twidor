## Twidor - a typing tutor for the Twiddler keyboard
Twidor is a typing tutor for the [Twiddler chording keyboard](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/).   A chord is formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a "chord" on a piano. There are [downloads for Windows, Linux and OSX](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases).  

Twidor was originally written by researchers studying
[chording keyboard learning and performance](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.3606&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Their
research suggests that learners may achieve faster typing speeds on single-handed chording keyboards than two-handed QWERTY keyboards given equal amount of practice.  In article [2] below, Lyons states, "faster typists would reach
60 WPM, the rate of our expert, after 10,000 phrases
(approximately 80 sessions or 27 hours) while the slower typists
could achieve 45 WPM."

## The Visual Key Map

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/Twidor_SCC.png"
width="40%" align="right">Twidor shows a visual key-map and lesson text. Labels in the key-map show the letters sent by each button.

The 4x3 array of buttons is composed of horizontal rows, for index finger on top, then middle, ring and pinky finger. Green, blue and red columns correspond to left, middle and right buttons on the Twiddler.

Twidor shows highlighted "hints" in green: the next letter of the lesson text ("d" shown on the right) and the buttons that send that letter.

Text entered by the user is shown below, in grey or red for correct or incorrect text, respectively.

By default, Twidor loads the the
[Backspice key-map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexBravo/Twiddler/master/Backspice2%20cheat%20sheet.txt).
Users may select the Default, TabSpace, or Typemax layouts in the <kbd>Keymaps</kbd> menu, or may load a custom key-map generated by the 
the [Twiddler Tuner](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml).

## 2-Button Chords

A "chord" is a keystroke using two or more buttons pressed simultaneously, like playing a "chord" on a piano.  To display labels for chords, shown on the right, select <kbd>View | Show chords</kbd>.

Each 4x3 sub-array shows letters sent by two buttons pressed simultaneously.  Button layout of the sub-array is the same: one row for each finger, and green/blue/red for left/middle/right columns.

The first button of the chord is the large box.  The location of the first button is relative to the larger 4x3 array.

The second button of the chord is a small box.  The position of the 2nd button is relative to the smaller 4x3 array.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/Twidor_chord_map.png"
width="25%" align="right">Here are some two-button chords whose first button is <kbd>I</kbd>:
* <kbd>I + S</kbd> sends "is".
* <kbd>I + N</kbd> sends "in".
* <kbd>I + SP</kbd> sends "C".
* <kbd>I + H</kbd> sends "Y".

## Multiple Character Chords (MCCs)

Some chords send more than one letter, such as "is", "in" and "it" in the key-map above. These are called a multiple character chords (MCCs). 

Twidor can optionally show hints for multiple character chords if you enable it.  However, by default Twidor shows green highlights only for chords that send a single character, as shown for the highlighted letter "d", above. This is intended to make learning easier initially.

If you wish to learn all available chords, un-check the box <kbd>View | Hint single letters only</kbd>.  This will show green highlighted  buttons for the longest matching multiple character chord. For example, given the text, "the", Twidor will highlight the chord that sends "the", rather than "th" or "t".

Note that this affects only the green highlighted "hints".  The Twiddler itself is capable of sending MCCs, and Twidor will accept MCCs as input, and score input text correspondingly regardless.

## Other Usage

Hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> at the end of a line to go to the next sentence. This also updates statistics for the session, including words per minute (WPM) and average error rate (AER).

Menu options include:
* <kbd>File | Load Keymap</kbd> imports a CSV key-map exported by the [Twiddler Tuner](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/).
* <kbd>File | Load Lesson</kbd> imports training text from a file.
* <kbd>Keyboard | Show..</kbd> toggles show/hide key labels and flips right-to-left orientation.
* <kbd>Hints | Highlight...</kbd> toggles show/hide which keys to press to send the next chord of the lesson.
* <kbd>Keymaps</kbd> loads certain key-maps: Backspice, Default_V5, TabSpace, or Typemax.

To load a custom key-map, users may:

* open https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml,
* import a keymap.cfg if not already present there.
* select 'Edit Configuration' for a given configuration file,
* with the configuration file open, select Export, and then CSV.
* download the CSV file.
* In Twidor, select <kbd>File | Load Keymap</kbd> and select the CSV file.

## How to Install

Download the releases from here:

[https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases)

On windows, download and run the Twidor-setup.exe installer.

On Linux and others, download Twidor.jar from the above link,
install Java, and invoke the application using javaw. For
example, on Debian or Ubuntu, one may use:

    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre
    javaw -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true -jar Twidor.jar Twidor

Feedback and reports of issues are
welcome [here](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/issues).

## Limitations

* Key-Map labels are shortened to the first three letters, which is currently sufficient for all of the popular key-maps.
* The visual key-map does not show the mouse buttons.

## How to Build

To compile and build Twidor.jar, one may use:

    sudo apt install git openjdk-8-jdk ant
    git clone https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor.git
    cd twidor
    ant

The [original Twidor source code and documentation](http://wearables.cc.gatech.edu/projects/twidor/) at Georgia Tech.

[Twidlit](https://github.com/pushkarkp/twidlit) is a a tutor and companion for The Twiddler keyboard. It
is intended to assist in all aspects of learning to twiddle and
developing a personal chord mapping. Like Twidor, Twidlit is
written in Java.

[twiddler_layout](https://github.com/ben-horner/twiddler_layout) is a command line tool for editing Twiddler keyboard layouts, also written in Java.

The [Backspice key-map](https://github.com/AlexBravo/Twiddler) by [Alex Bravo](https://plus.google.com/+AlexBravo).

The [TabSpace 3 layout](http://ivanwfr.github.io/Twiddler3-Layout/) discusses a range of layout issues, including n-gram occurrence frequency and ranking the dexterity required for various multi-key chords.

The [Typemax layout](https://github.com/lancegatlin/typemax)
maximizes typing speed by emphasizing efficient single character
chord transitions (stride). The Typemax github repo has discussions of
[Basic Layout Design](https://github.com/lancegatlin/typemax/blob/master/basic_layout_design.md),
including issues of stride and n-gram clustering, stutter,
separation of vowels and consonants on separate fingers, using
mouse buttons as letter keys, and many other design issues.
