width="50%" align="right">
Twidor is a typing tutor for the [Twiddler one-handed keyboard](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/).

Twidor was originally written by researchers studying
[Twiddler learning rates and performance](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.3606&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Their
research suggests that learners may achive faster typing speeds on single-handed chording keyboards than two-handed QWERTY keyboards given equal amount of practice.  In article [2] below, Lyons states, "faster typists would reach
60 WPM, the rate of our expert, after 10,000 phrases
(approximately 80 sessions or 27 hours) while the slower typists
could achieve 45 WPM."

## How to Install

Download the releases from here:

[https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases)

On windows, download and run the Twidor-setup.exe installer.

On Linux and others, download Twidor.jar from the above link,
install Java, and invoke the application using javaw. For
example, on Debian or Ubuntu, one may use:

    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre
    javaw -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true -jar Twidor.jar Twidor

Feedback and reports of issues are
welcome [here](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/issues).

## Usage

Hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> at the end of a line to go to the next sentence.

By default, Twidor loads the the
[Backspice keymap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexBravo/Twiddler/master/Backspice2%20cheat%20sheet.txt).
Users may select others in the <kbd>Keymaps</kbd> menu, or load  custom keymaps generated by the 
the [official Twiddler layout editor](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml).

Menu options include:
* <kbd>File | Load Keymap</kbd> imports a CSV keymap exported by the Twiddler Tuner.
* <kbd>File | Load Lesson</kbd> imports a arbitrary ascii text file, displayed one line at a time.
* <kbd>Keyboard | Show..</kbd> to show/hide key labels or flip right-to-left orientation.
* <kbd>Hints | Highlight...</kbd> to show/hide buttons for the next letter of the lesson.
* <kbd>Keymaps</kbd> for Backspice, Default_V5, TabSpace, or Typemax.

To use a custom keymap, users may generate a keymap and load it as follows:

* open https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml,
* load the kemmap.cfg if not alreay present there.
* select 'Edit Configuration' for a given configuration file,
* with the configuration file open, select Export, and then CSV.
* download the CSV file.
* In Twidor, select <kbd>File | Load Keymap</kbd> and select the CSV file.

## Limitations

* Labels for macro keys are shortened to the first three letters.
* Up/down/right/left arrows key labels are not shown (current lessons do not use them).
* Mouse buttons are not displayed. 

## How to Build

To compile and build Twidor.jar, one may use:

    sudo apt install git openjdk-8-jdk ant
    git clone https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor.git
    cd twidor
    ant

[Twidlit](https://github.com/pushkarkp/twidlit) is a a tutor and companion for The Twiddler keyboard. It
is intended to assist in all aspects of learning to twiddle and
developing a personal chord mapping. Like Twidor, Twidlit is
written in Java.

[twiddler_layout](https://github.com/ben-horner/twiddler_layout) is a command line tool for editing Twiddler keyboard layouts, also written in Java.
