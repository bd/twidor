## Twidor - a typing tutor for the Twiddler keyboard
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/twiddler.jpg" width="15%" align="right"> 

Twidor teaches typing on the
[Twiddler chording keyboard](https://twiddler.tekgear.com).
A chord is formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a "chord" on a piano. There are 
[downloads for Windows, Linux and OSX](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases).
 
Twidor was originally written by researchers studying
[chording keyboard learning and performance](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.3606&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Their
research suggests that learners may achieve faster typing speeds on single-handed chording keyboards than two-handed QWERTY keyboards given equal amount of practice.  In article [2] below, Lyons states, "faster typists would reach
60 WPM, the rate of our expert, after 10,000 phrases
(approximately 80 sessions or 27 hours) while the slower typists
could achieve 45 WPM."

## The Keyboard Layout

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/Twidor_single.png"
width="30%" align="right">
Twidor shows a visual keyboard layout and lesson text. Labels in the layout show the characters sent by each button.

Four thumb buttons are on top. Below, rows from top to bottom correspond to index, middle, ring and pinky fingers. Green, blue and red borders match the coloring on the Twiddler's physical buttons.  

Twidor shows highlighted "hints" in red: the next letter of the lesson, "e" and the button that send the letter "e".

Text entered by the user is shown below. Incorrect letters appear darker.

## Chords

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/Twidor_SCC.png"
width="30%" align="right">
A "chord" is two or more buttons pressed at the same time, like playing a "chord" on a piano.

In the lesson shown on the right, the letter "m" is formed by the "SP" (space) and "g" buttons.

Twidor will optionally show a map of the two-button chords, when the menu item <kbd>View | Show chords</kbd> is selected.

## View | Show Chords

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/Twidor_screenshot.png"
width="20%" align="right">
Each small button shows the letters sent by a two-button chord.  The small button layout is the same as above: one row for each finger, and green/blue/red columns.

The first button of the chord is a given small box.  The position of the first button is relative to the array of small buttons.

The second button of the chord is the large box to the immediate left of the given small button.  The location of the first button is relative to the array of large buttons.

For example, here are some two-button chords:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/Twidor_chord_map.png" width="40%" align="right">
* <kbd>g   + SP</kbd> sends "m".
* <kbd>DEL + SP</kbd> sends "o".
* <kbd>BS  + SP</kbd> sends "p".
* <kbd>f   + SP</kbd> sends "l".

## Multiple Character Chords (MCCs)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/Twidor_MCC.png" width="30%" align="right"> Some chords send more than one letter, such as "is", "in" and "it" in the key-map above. These are called multiple character chords (MCCs). 

Twidor can optionally show hints for multiple character chords if you enable it.  However, by default Twidor shows green highlights only for chords that send a single character, as shown for the highlighted letter "d", above.  This is intended to make learning easier initially.

If you wish to learn all available chords, un-check the box <kbd>View | Hint single letters only</kbd>.
This will show green highlighted  buttons for the longest matching multiple character chord.
For example, given the text, "the", Twidor will highlight the chord that sends "the", rather than "th" or "t".

Note that this affects only the green highlighted "hints".  Regardless, the Twiddler can send MCCs, and Twidor accepts input MCCs.

## Alternate Keymaps

By default, Twidor loads the the
[Backspice layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexBravo/Twiddler/master/Backspice2%20cheat%20sheet.txt).
Users may select the Default, TabSpace, or Typemax layouts in the <kbd>Keymaps</kbd> menu, or may load a custom key-map generated by the 
the [Twiddler Tuner](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml).

## Other Usage

Hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> at the end of a line to go to the next sentence. The words per minute (WPM) and average error rate (AER) are updated when <kbd>ENTER</kbd> is pressed.

Lessons 1-7 each present a random set of phrases. The lessons progress through various subsets of the alphabet (e.g. letters aâ€“h in lesson 1), progressing to larger subsets in later lessons. 

Lessons 8 and 9, borrowed from GNU Typist, provide longer texts with capitalization, numbers and special characters.

Menu options include:
* <kbd>File | Load Keymap</kbd> imports a CSV key-map exported by the [Twiddler Tuner](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/).
* <kbd>File | Load Lesson</kbd> imports training text from a file.
* <kbd>View | Show..</kbd> toggles show/hide key labels and flips right-to-left orientation.
* <kbd>View | Highlight...</kbd> toggles show/hide which keys to press to send the next letter of the lesson.
* <kbd>Keymaps</kbd> loads certain key-maps: Backspice, Default_V5, TabSpace, or Typemax.

To load a custom key-map, users may:

* open https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml,
* import a keymap.cfg if not already present there.
* select 'Edit Configuration' for a given configuration file,
* with the configuration file open, select Export, and then CSV.
* download the CSV file.
* In Twidor, select <kbd>File | Load Keymap</kbd> and select the CSV file.

## How to Install

Download the releases from here:

[https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases)

On windows, download and run the Twidor-setup.exe installer.

On Debian or Ubuntu, download the twidor-x.x.deb. To install and run it one may use:

    dpkg -i twidor-x.x.deb
    twidor

On other Linux, OSX, and unix variants, download Twidor.jar from the above link,
install openjdk-8-jre, and invoke the application using:

    java -jar Twidor.jar

Feedback and reports of issues are
welcome [here](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/issues).

## Limitations

* Key-Map labels are shortened to the first three letters, which is currently sufficient for all of the popular key-maps.
* The visual key-map does not show the mouse buttons.

## How to Build

To compile and build Twidor.jar, one may use:

    sudo apt install git openjdk-8-jdk ant make
    git clone https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor.git
    cd twidor
    make

[Twidlit](https://github.com/pushkarkp/twidlit) is a a tutor and companion for The Twiddler keyboard. It
is intended to assist in all aspects of learning to twiddle and
developing a personal chord mapping. Like Twidor, Twidlit is
written in Java.

[twiddler_layout](https://github.com/ben-horner/twiddler_layout) is a command line tool for editing Twiddler keyboard layouts, also written in Java.

The [Backspice key-map](https://github.com/AlexBravo/Twiddler) by [Alex Bravo](https://plus.google.com/+AlexBravo).

The [TabSpace 3 layout](http://ivanwfr.github.io/Twiddler3-Layout/) discusses a range of layout issues, including n-gram occurrence frequency and ranking the dexterity required for various multi-key chords.

The [Typemax layout](https://github.com/lancegatlin/typemax)
maximizes typing speed by emphasizing efficient single character
chord transitions (stride). The Typemax github repo has discussions of
[Basic Layout Design](https://github.com/lancegatlin/typemax/blob/master/basic_layout_design.md),
including issues of stride and n-gram clustering, stutter,
separation of vowels and consonants on separate fingers, using
mouse buttons as letter keys, and many other design issues.
