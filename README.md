## Twidor - a typing tutor for the Twiddler keyboard
Twidor is a typing tutor for the [Twiddler one-handed chording keyboard](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/).   A "chord" is a keystroke using two, three or four keys pressed simultaneously. There are [downloads for Windows, Linux and OSX](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases).  

Twidor was originally written by researchers studying
[Twiddler learning rates and performance](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.3606&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Their
research suggests that learners may achieve faster typing speeds on single-handed chording keyboards than two-handed QWERTY keyboards given equal amount of practice.  In article [2] below, Lyons states, "faster typists would reach
60 WPM, the rate of our expert, after 10,000 phrases
(approximately 80 sessions or 27 hours) while the slower typists
could achieve 45 WPM."

## The Visual Key Map

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/Twidor_screenshot.png"
width="40%" align="right">Twidor's visual keymap shows the letters sent by each key.  Some letters require only a single key press, show by the large boxes.  Other letters reqire two keys pressed simultaneously, called a "chord".  The small boxes show two-key chords. 

The key of the next letter of the lesson is shown by the box highlighed yellow.

By default, Twidor loads the the
[Backspice keymap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexBravo/Twiddler/master/Backspice2%20cheat%20sheet.txt).
Users may select others in the <kbd>Keymaps</kbd> menu, or by loading a custom keymap generated by the 
the [official Twiddler layout editor](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml).

The 4x3 array is composed of four horizontal rows, one for each finger, and green/blue/red columns corresponding to left, middle and right keys on the Twiddler.  Each large box shows the letter sent by a single key press.

## Chording

A chord is formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a "chord" on a piano.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rich-murphey/twidor/master/web.assets/Twidor_chord_map.png"
width="30%" align="right"> Each small 4x3 array shows letters sent by two keys pressed simultaneously.  The orientation mirrors that of the larger 4x3 array: one row for each finger, and green/blue/red for left, middle and right columns.

The first key of the chord is the large key to the immediate left.  

The second key of the chord is one of the small keys which show the letters sent by the chord.

Here are some two-key chords whose first key is <kbd>I</kbd>:
* <kbd>I + S</kbd> sends "is".
* <kbd>I + N</kbd> sends "in".
* <kbd>I + SP</kbd> sends "C".
* <kbd>I + H</kbd> sends "Y".

## Usage

Hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> at the end of a line to go to the next sentence.

Menu options include:
* <kbd>File | Load Keymap</kbd> imports a CSV keymap exported by the [Twiddler Tuner](https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/).
* <kbd>File | Load Lesson</kbd> imports training text from a file.
* <kbd>Keyboard | Show..</kbd> toggles show/hide key labels and flips right-to-left orientation.
* <kbd>Hints | Highlight...</kbd> toggles show/hide which keys to press to send the next chord of the lesson.
* <kbd>Keymaps</kbd> loads certain keymaps: Backspice, Default_V5, TabSpace, or Typemax.

To load a custom keymap, users may:

* open https://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/edit.xhtml,
* import a keymap.cfg if not already present there.
* select 'Edit Configuration' for a given configuration file,
* with the configuration file open, select Export, and then CSV.
* download the CSV file.
* In Twidor, select <kbd>File | Load Keymap</kbd> and select the CSV file.

## How to Install

Download the releases from here:

[https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/releases)

On windows, download and run the Twidor-setup.exe installer.

On Linux and others, download Twidor.jar from the above link,
install Java, and invoke the application using javaw. For
example, on Debian or Ubuntu, one may use:

    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre
    javaw -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true -jar Twidor.jar Twidor

Feedback and reports of issues are
welcome [here](https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor/issues).

## Limitations

* Labels for macro keys are shortened to the first three
  letters. This is currently not an issue because current
  keymaps have no more than 2-letter macros in 2-button chords.
* Up/down/right/left arrows key labels are not shown, since current lessons do not use them.
* For Typemax, while the keyboards does not show mouse buttons,
  mapped mouse buttons do work for training purposes.
* Twidor silently ignores input of upper-case letters, since the
  original design was for training on lower case only.

## How to Build

To compile and build Twidor.jar, one may use:

    sudo apt install git openjdk-8-jdk ant
    git clone https://github.com/rich-murphey/twidor.git
    cd twidor
    ant

## Other Relevant Projects

The [original Twidor source code and documentation](http://wearables.cc.gatech.edu/projects/twidor/) at Georgia Tech.

[Twidlit](https://github.com/pushkarkp/twidlit) is a a tutor and companion for The Twiddler keyboard. It
is intended to assist in all aspects of learning to twiddle and
developing a personal chord mapping. Like Twidor, Twidlit is
written in Java.

[twiddler_layout](https://github.com/ben-horner/twiddler_layout) is a command line tool for editing Twiddler keyboard layouts, also written in Java.

The [Backspice keymap](https://github.com/AlexBravo/Twiddler) by [Alex Bravo](https://plus.google.com/+AlexBravo).

The [TabSpace 3 layout](http://ivanwfr.github.io/Twiddler3-Layout/) discusses a range of layout issues, including ngram occurrence frequency and ranking the dexterity required for various multi-key chords.

The [Typemax layout](https://github.com/lancegatlin/typemax)
maximizes typing speed by emphasizing efficent single character
chord transitions (stride). The Typemax github repo has discussions of
[Basic Layout Design](https://github.com/lancegatlin/typemax/blob/master/basic_layout_design.md),
including issues of stride and ngram clustering, stutter,
separation of vowels and consonants on separate fingers, using
mouse buttons as letter keys, and many other desing issues.
