up to date i can not see that the thing is as good as this one.
uch pos oug ept ing ope hic ati sch cou get ice con goo ght
nan is cute.  she can sing and dance.  she can tap a piano.
tonight nan opens the piano.  she sings such good songs and
soon dashes into a dance.  nan can dance.  the noise stops.
nan gets us going.  the dance is on.  ted pounds the piano
as ann stops to go to the phone.  she has to get the gang.
this chance scene passes too soon.  i hope it happens again.
at eight papa said that he ought to put out his good pipe
and then get a good nap.  soon papa is snug in a deep nap.
at eight ten i guess the dance gets going.  at ten it stops.
as papa put it, such singing upsets him enough for one night.
get the gang.  catch this sign.  get going.  go up this high
post and put a sign on top.  put these copies on each post.
i guess no one intends to stop us.  the cast is set.  each
scene is set.  each act can open in good shape.  i hope that
enough cash is paid in so the cast need not stand the costs.
# from now on, i will be mixing speed exercises in with the lessons.  in the
# drills that you have been doing, i make you keep practicing a line until
# you get it right.  in a speed exercise, i will only display the text once.
# what will be different is that i will be timing you.  from the time you type
# the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
# stopwatch will be running.  when you finish, i will calculate your typing speed
# and convert it to words per minute (wpm).  i will also count each of the
# mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.
# if you make a mistake, i will beep at you and light up the letter that you
# should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).
# just keep going and try to make as few errors as possible.
only too well do we know about your house.  mother told
me you hope to be settled there quite soon.  of course she
would enjoy seeing the whole house next week.  before then
please write her a letter to let her know how to get there
from here.  we know you have moved to a very cozy new home.
the high dance opens at eight and the gang is going.
so ted shuts the piano and stops at the phone to catch ann.
i ought to post ted that he pounds the piano as i once did.
i guess he is upset.  he has to catch dad to get the cash.
he has to see ann to each dance.  this is not a noisy night.
his auto is a cheap one and no good on a night such as this.
the gang can use the piano and good songs to open the dance.

it is a good thing to use good habits each time you practice.
thr pre rec ear ers ure urn gre art ore her are ter ere tru
dad and his son, dan, are to go east on a great auto trip.
the phone rings.  dan hopes the rain has not upset the trip.
soon the pair share a snug rug and start out in our red car.
on a poor, rough road, dan dares to rush in the rain.  soon
he sees a horse ahead.  he tries hard to stop.  the car hits
and then turns around.  the horse runs east at a great rate.
in order to raise a poor grade one tries to use good sense.
an error is a sure sign not to do the thing that one did.
an error seen once does not hurt.  as soon as an error is
seen or heard again, note its sort and end it right there.
her error is a sign that this thing or that has upset her.
does she care?  is it a hard part?  she has to get used to
the letters that she has to print.  is this order upset?
is she tired?  then she needs a short rest.  is it the rate?
she need not raise her rate too high.  has she a good touch?
#
hugh thought he ought to start that night although the
weather might hurt his health.  hal thought they ought to go
to arizona together the thirtieth of june.  both hastened
through the streets to their very high hotel.  hal hesitated
to start north without warm clothes.  although he hated to
hurt his health, hugh started north quickly on the sixteenth.
dad and his son are to start on a trip in our red car.
house cares are the sort that upset dad and he is so tired
that he tries a nap in order to rest.  it rains at a great
rate.  dan is too sure.  he has heard this road is poor in
parts.  it is a great error, dan, to rush a short turn on a
grade.  the car turns out and ends on its side.  hurt?  no.
dad had a short rest in order to start on the hard car trip.

as a rule call earlier on all orders as long as this one.
als ple gla ulo clo ile ill oul all eas onl ion tle lea ndl
as a rule it is the real line drill that helps one to learn.
it helps to read a line as soon as one can.  it helps to see
its sense.  this, indeed, helps to hold each line until done.
as soon as one hits a hard place then one plans to drill on
this part.  later one can drill this hard part again.  in
order to end an error one can drill all the old line again.
learn the sound as one uses loose hands to type out a line.
as one types his usual rate he ought to learn its sound until
at this rate all the line has the usual, clean, clear sound.
as soon as the usual rate is lost one can hear it as a slip.
total lines that one turns out tell all that one is young.
in order that this class also can print a large line total,
it still helps to spell; it also helps to print all the line
as one line, and it helps less and less to drill single
letters.  each one in the class can tell his total lines.
dear ted,
a day ago ann got a bad cut on her arm and a few by her
eye and ear.  it is an act of god she did not die.  her car
did the job.  it is the end of her car.  she has no use for a
car.  the fee is to be big.  she is in bed, but she can not
eat.  she can not eat a bit of egg.  it is no fun at all.
it is hot.  it is too hot for her fur hat, but i can buy
a box for it.  i am due any day.  i can cut a day if i fly.
it is not far if i go by air.  if i go by car, i add a day.
how is dan?  did he get his job?  dan had to beg for it
if he did.  he is big and fat but not bad.  the boy can do
it if he can act to fit his age.  ask him not to act as a kid.
yours sincerely,
to tell this class all there is to learn is not a real
help later.  let the class plan the loose ease that can hold
each hand in place, or plan to end this or that poor slip,
or plan to do its total lines in less hours.  as a rule, to
plan and to do are also to learn.  the class plans to drop
the old action to clear the road.  those old slips are lost.
the class has large plans; gains in hours and less slips.
to learn to read or spell a rule helps less than to drill.

after that date i believe he can not say that it is not a fact.
any for efo fte day fin you ful ery nly hey afk ays fro say
i feel sorry to say i can not send a full order on that day.
forty-odd pounds is all that i can spare at this early date.
all loose lots are sent on fast local lines at a half rate,
so there is close to no delay and you also do not lose any.
it is fine, fresh stuff and our first fancy fruit this year.
this offer is only for fancy fresh fruit to be used as gifts.
try these and candy to suit the young lady.  they are dandy.
you can feel safe.  sales are easy and final.  they go fast.
after at least four days you can order daily or on friday.
dear ted,
after i read your dandy note i felt sorry for the lady.
here is plenty of cash if you young people agree to spend it
sanely.  is it for a natty sail or only for golf?  did you and
dan play or fight?  dan said he felt as if a full load of
coal hit his head.  is that fact or fancy?
yours sincerely,
sadness possesses her as she stands against the panes
that the sash separates.  she is sad because the same dress
is not washed and in shape; and so she says it is useless to
save it.  she is sad also because she has to stay in alabama
next season.  she says to plan to sail across the seas to
alaska or asia or spain is useless.  so in june she amuses
herself by drawing five or six quaint, small-sized maps.
they say this fruit is the finest.  it is full and good.
dr. ted feels the first fruit is too green for young or old.
after one eats any of it he is sorry.  in fact, if i try it,
that night in fancy i sail the south seas for eight hours.
the air is fine and clear; on the ship are only fruit and i.
to a lady in those seas i gladly offer all fruit and candy.
there is no reply.  only the seas run high and i feel ill.
the young lady often has pounds of fruit and candy each day.

in any case there is only one order that is long past due.
est ace ric ity red per der pro sel par ish ial ing eal let
to learn to type, first get a nice rate going, then hold it.
if you read copy set your eyes on that copy and stay on it.
if you hear copy then use your eyes to hit sure and fast.
do not hurry.  set a nice rate.  yet hit each letter fast.
to strike letters start easily and fast and use a light touch.
you can not type lightly and faster if you start to pound.
it is a slip if you do not use a letter in its right order,
since in line after line each has its place on the paper.
you soon learn the usual order for all letters that you type
and learn to print the letters in any necessary order.
it is easy at first to make errors by losing this usual order.
if you read, hold the eyes on copy to help get this order.
if you do hit this or that letter out of order, it is not
that you fail to spell.  you can spell and yet not type;
this fine class drill is to help the type fly in fair order.
dear tom,
mr. may has one new car.  it has a low red top.  the top
is so low you can not see the sun if you sit in the car.  mr.
may has not let his own son use it.  i saw his son try to put
the top up.  i ran and met him.  why not be men and run the car
out?  we did.  we set out to run it at six.  we two ran it off
to an old lot by the sea.
did his pa see us?  yes, sir, who but pa was at no. ten
as we ran by in the car--and ma, too.  oh, it was war--his pa
had a lot to say.  let me lay out the law to you.  you may not
use the car as you did not pay for it.  you are not yet a man.
son did not lie nor did he win his way.
how are you all?  now if you get a new car, let me run it.
yours sincerely,
is it quite certain that the citizens could continue the
old conditions if they voted a straight ticket?  if we accept
as accurate the picture of recent conditions, we can not crave
to continue them.  we lack the tact to get the citizens to
vote a split ticket.  tax collectors try to collect taxes on
vacant lots.  a discount for cash increases collections.
in order to type fast you hit lightly after each short delay.

it seems to me that we want to know what was said just now.
ent ake mon mak tim kin orm omp rom ork mys kno com ome mr.
ant may was way now job wit toi wri jus wil jul whi wou whe
let me have a horse where the wide west still runs wild.
i must see the warm colors, and feel the wind on that land.
i want to see a few cows among great rocks and sage brush.
i like to hear a horse stamp.  i like the sweat on a horse.
i want to keep a camp, close to water, miles from any crowd.
at night, i want to enjoy a moon that shines on all the land.
yet i am in this city room to type news items for the paper.
i know the ins and outs of my city--its mayor, judge, jail.
i know how some men keep in power, and some get only kicks.
i am sick of dark ways to make money, of bribery and fraud.
i want to hear the talk of folks who know hot sun and stock.
i like to join in jokes with men whose names i do not ask.
so had i just an old motor car and some gas to make it jump,
i would come at forty miles an hour, past fields of wheat,
till the grade grows high and rough, in keen air out west.
please report the people who study typing.  you may
truly say that money paid for this study is happily spent.
today typing plays a very practical part in acquiring a
paying position.  we can use plenty of these days for exact
work in typing:  monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday,
and saturday.  have you this sized type to print your copy?
were you the judge in a case like this, could you do the
just thing?  an old woman who keeps rooms hides her money
under a clock.  a man using one of the rooms motors rapidly
away.  the old woman says her money is gone.  we join in a
hunt for the man who is found in the west.  we take from him
the same sum of money.  we try to make him sweat and talk.
i use my power to set his term at ten years.  after he is put
in jail, the old woman finds her money still under the clock.
how do we know which way so wild a horse will kick or jump?

with that end in view i may soon have to put this question.
ave hav eve ver ove quo not ive giv qui vis que ved eiv tha
at our new villa a very novel event was given for the navy.
covers were laid in the unique ivory room.  even the king
and queen were there with a quota of fair and lovely ladies.
the queen was ready to quaff when her glass fell.  at once
all was quiet.  every one, save one alone, quit the dance.
in all their lives, to quote, was never a thing more grave.
who was the lady with the vivid hair in the dress of heavy
gold?  who was this queer one who dared so treat the queen?
each guest did quail.  could such quiet nerve ever avail?
with a move quite free and easy the lady let fall her glass.
the queen put this query in a quick voice to quell them all:
why does the whole world love a lover?  why do we value you?
all did laugh.  the queen asked that, as a favor, you give us
those who have nerve, for they can love and serve.  quite as
one who gave an equal favor, the queen sang over the radio.
the earliest possible sales lessen the total losses.
please enclose the latest details in those lists yourself.
on almost all calls i could save six dollars, especially in
july.  tell the girls all the usual questions asked will be
useful shortly.  use a small-sized envelope to post letters.
last but not least, all else should still go on as usual.
in our queen city i used to value two covers set every
day.  at these i used to serve a young man and a girl.  i did
love to see her quiet dress and quick smile favor her so.
i have never quite seen her equal, or a girl so very alive.
after i had given over this work, i went there to see them.
one night i saw a query form on her lips until she gave it
up and took leave.  the way she quit the boy was very queer
even if the papers did quote his prison term as five years.
even her very quick smile never makes us quite at our ease.

i don't know why he can't have a large-sized order for you.

i'd never call dan lazy; still, i can't say he wins prizes.
doesn't dan know how to make an exclamation point?  he'll
have to hold down the spacer and hit the apostrophe and period.
owing to dan's zeal, he'll get the point; he'll realize it's
faster.  he'll use it when amazed, as:  whiz!  he'll use it
when he feels real zest, as:  zip!  let's go!  it's a fire!
a dozen small-sized craft frozen in the ice are afire under
a cold azure sky.  it's near zero in the fire zone; and over
the ships now razed to the water's edge, a light haze hangs.
i'm dazed as i gaze at my own ship; i'd never recognize that
crazy maze of still fizzing ruins as a deck.  what a fizzle!
isn't there a lot of zip and zest to your work on a paper of
this size?  don't you like to seize some amazing news item
that's good for the first page?  if tom's hazy fire story is
a fizzle, why won't you squeeze it to a dozen lines?  isn't
that easy for you?  i've wanted to see my name in print; i
guess i'll sail in a zeppelin to see if you'll print that.
a note from ann says her friend prefers to change her
return to arizona from next february to november.  the reason
is an error of the owner of the ranch who will not refund
her rent.  the janitor is running some errand, for he has
worked in the rain near the northern entrance during dinner.
i hear that now neither her friends from north carolina nor
virginia can remain an afternoon and refrain from a quarrel.
i'll admit i seize a chance to go with these dozen
people.  we left under an azure sky, yet today it's rainy
and hazy.  that dr. tedd is odd; he won't play; he's doing
a report on how to zone cities of any size; so he won't let
us dance to radio jazz.  tonight we're to try a play that
hasn't any zest or zip.  its prize is tom's money, and he'll
not stay; he feels it's a fizzle.  my zeal for gazing on the
crowd is at zero.  they don't and can't pass any play quiz.
it's crazy for me to type news items on paper of this size!

to some extent he has been able to do the next best thing.
abo bet bee ble bou bef ext ber six sib nex abl aby mbe box
dad just about broke down at the bad news.  bill has no job.
dad was vexed.  he said that he might as well burn his bonds
next.  he has sixty bonds but the prices sent all below par.
dad talks about a jinx.  he says that maybe their bank will
close so he cannot pay up taxes and bills before christmas.
dad says they all may have to exist on home-grown wax beans.
dad adds that boys ought to be busy and maybe play ball or
box at the club.  bill excels, but says he cannot box on
wax beans alone.  beef must be back on the board.  bill has
boxed as an extra at a bazaar.  he is big, and able to box.
bill begs dad not to be blue, and his text is this:  we
are all in the same boat.  no one can buy.  no one can build.
labor is hard hit, too.  i, for one, would like to toss the
cards on the table and start a new deal.  when exact codes
are fixed, as best for all, every person must do his bit.
satisfy yourself that it will be funny, but perfectly
satisfactory, for forty or fifty of the faculty to fly from
buffalo to new york on the first friday in february.  if
they prefer, we will offer them waffles, jelly, and coffee
before they fly or get dizzy.  sixty flyers can qualify
confidently to face any difficulty.  a friendly inquiry
from any family will be very cheerfully and fully answered.
children find being quizzed in division, addition, and
reading difficult.  they studied daily during their third
period and tried to be confident.  i think they did include
florida and rhode island in their wide reading; and have
just decided to dispose of detroit, grand rapids, richmond,
providence, and philadelphia next week.
by using the new banks of keys on the new keyboard, you
are able to learn or excel with less labor.  these new banks
have been based on an exact table of words used.  you begin
at once on the best bank.  on the old keyboard you have to
type most of the text on the next bank above and on the bank
below.  because of this fact your fingers bound back and
forth between the upper and lower banks of keys.  but those
extra jumps necessary on the old keyboard do not exist on the
new keyboard.  nor is your left hand taxed with extra labor.
the keys are fixed to keep both hands busy and in balance.
those boxes of books for new mexico may be ready next week.

i am going to be lazy this weekend and do just what i want.
today i quit being vexed with the old job.  i must seize
one extra bit of zest and join the exit from the big city.
to begin with, the same old auto will bear us to the beach
where a good-sized boat floats easily in the blue water.
our boat is build for room.  her cabin has a busy table.
i know nan will come if bill does, and ted likes to be with
ann.  i would never quite have the nerve to keep my good
board back when our club navy moves out into the quiet water.
we leave at an early hour when the sun is still under cover.
all day will be warm and novel.  the far banks will slide by
while we gaze.  she is an out-and-out able boat, heavy but
never gives trouble.  she is never taxed in quick water.  i
feel the water jump and break.  queer how i feel the bond
that exists between me and my boat.  she is a prize i value.
some women swim in the spring.  some women swim in
the warm water of summer.  women in brazil may swim even in
november.  some women from japan will swim tomorrow.  we want
to show the women from new mexico and wyoming how to swim in
winter.  we will work with them for a few weeks.  when they
go home we wonder if they will write from time to time.
i'm going to obtain oil options tonight and to file my
copies without noise, or outside notice.  i am anxious to
avoid an action.  if i voice an official opinion, i will omit
serious points.  knowing conditions, i am hoping that i'll
be enjoying a glorious addition to my income.  i am going to
join society and be social with juniors and seniors alike.
bound for some place where the sun sets in the west,
soon it is the night that i favor.  next to the night and
boat and water, maybe i judge our sail by its excellent bill
of fare.  here i am very exact, as i never set a poor table.
i stock an up-to-date table, set out under the first dozen
stars.  i enjoy having every boy able to quaff his quota of
soup and boast or sing with zeal and make any queer joke.
with a moon, i can name no event to equal a boat and water.
it is good drill to keep going in even time for ten minutes.

to buy an air-mail stamp i save 1, 2, 4, and at last 6 cents.
in two years my dollar earns 1, 3, 5, 7, and perhaps 8 cents.
buy at once:  4 candy balls,9 bars, 6 or 8 of gum, 2 cakes.
2 and 2 are 4; 3 and 3 are 6; 4 and 4 are 8; 5 and 0 are 5.
3 and 4 are 7; 5 and 4 are 9; 2 and 6 are 8; 7 and 0 are 7.
1 and 1 are 2; 3 and 1 are 4; 5 and 1 are 6; 7 and 1 are 8.
i have finished grade 9b.  in my first weeks of typing in
grade 10a, i learned to use all the keys in lessons 3 and 4.
in lessons 1 and 2, and in part of no.5, i tried my hands on
the home row.  both lessons 6 and 7 were in the bank above.
typing is clerical work.  twenty years ago less than 5 per
cent of all those at work had clerical jobs; today, about 8
per cent have such jobs.  does it interest you that of all
paid typists only 3 per cent are more than 44 years of age?
most of the 810,000 typists in the last census are young.
to throw a carriage do you take 6 or 7 times--or to shift for
a capital, 2 or 3 times--as long as to hit one letter?  and
do you know the common keys?  one common pair of letters is used
for every 3 or 4 other pairs, even though there are more than
600 other pairs.  the digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
you will spell these out more often than you will type them.
i am vexed if my prize went to my old address, 55 fifth avenue.

as soon as you can type at 12 words a minute, jump to 24;
later to 30, 36, 42, 48, or other rate that seems to fit.
on one day in june the heat ran to 106, 103, 98, 95, 92, in
some cities, but only to 40, 43, 47, 50, 51, 52, 60 in other
cities.  rain fell from .00 or .04 to .40 or to .68 inches.
the next step in better typing is to learn to graph a curve.
if your test score each week rises from 22 to 28, 32, 37,
40, 44, 48, 51, 53, and 55 words a minute, put these on a
chart.  see this curve grow higher each week.  or use bars.
the usual test scores point to waste in many a class.  after
all the work of a first term, girls may reach only 25 words
a minute, boys only 22 words.  at the end of 34 weeks these
usual scores might be 29 or 31 or 34.  indeed, 25 to 33 per
cent of the students may type less than 20 words per minute.
eleven invitations for thanksgiving vacation arrived in
advance of november.  in vain have a dozen relatives invited
me to visit vermont, virginia, and nevada.  i love being
invited and i believe in never avoiding an invitation to any
thanksgiving banquet.  i even plan to have the sixth to the
seventeenth of november for varied ventures and to visit
that novel denver university on my vacation.
how much do you weigh?  a young boy who is 5 feet tall
may weigh 112 pounds; with an extra inch, 115 pounds.  add 3
pounds for any inch added.  thus if 5 feet and 4 inches, he
may weigh 124.  if taller, add 4 pounds for each added inch.
if 5 feet and 7 inches, he may weigh 136; if 5 feet and 9
inches, 144; if 5 feet and 10 inches, he may weigh 148.  now
add 5 pounds for each added inch.  thus to stand 6 feet tall
may mean 158 pounds.  it is better to be a little over-weight.
in order to park on sixth at 11:05 we have to beat 135 cars!
