my totals were:  $2,309, $5,687, $3,498, $2,408, and $3,697.
a student may type 1 word per minute faster for each added
year of age: i.e., 13 to 14, to 15, to 16, to 17, to 18.
often 25% of first-year students never do 25 words a minute.
many second-year students can type about 45 words a minute.
more than 50% do not equal the practical rate of 50 words.
why do we all thrill over sports?  maybe it is the tireless
skill of the winner that we feel.  ask the players.  they
may agree (rice,* famous as a sports writer, said the cham-
pions all agreed) that skill is only part (50%) of it.
"when you step on the first tee," says the four-time gold
champion, bobby jones, "you know you can't afford to make
one careless slip."  a tired bobby jones (this was the way
bobby told it to rice) has stood on the 16th tee, leading
smith by 18 strokes.
"up to this point," says bobby, "i had played 33 holes in 11
under par.  i believe it was the best golf i ever played in
my life.  but after easing up on the mental side i played
the last three holes in 5 over par."
in 1919 babe ruth shot into the records with 29 home runs.
yet few know that the babe worked five years in big games
before this start that led past home run #600.  you may
have cheered jimmy foxx and many another.  yet you can still
picture the babe after two strikes, smashing to the very
spot he had "called" a famous home run.
it is the effort against odds that thrills.  we feel these
drives that never let down.  we feel (this was the way rice
put it) the champion forces himself into the winning frame of
mind.  can the fast typist afford to do less?  a typist has
to face such days of "mental torture" too.  some days he has
to force himself along.  he need not punish his machine.  he
must pull himself together (100%) to type his steady, smooth
way over all upsets.
men are bound to believe that business is bad in winter
months.  maybe mr. smith remembers that most building became
better in september but both november and december seemed to
be much behind.  monday morning my mail box became blocked
by urgent requests of many families that small-sized homes
be built.  some jobs may begin to come now from the chamber
of commerce members.
i said, "never promise to take much money to such places."

dear dan,
yes, i came out of the corn, back to the city, both to
draw and to do copy on the new cars.  to date i am able to
put cash in the bank and bear a bill or two.  the new deed
has done it.
the city has been busy but cold for two days.  dear baby
has been to see her best aunt.  a band came by the door.
baby let the bird cage drop down with a blow.  the bird died.
boys put its dead body deep in a dark card case.  baby also
has a ball and blue book to drop.  i put the boat away.  its
deck did burn, but i care not as it does not cost a cent.
come, call on me at the club.
yours sincerely,
dear bea,
i am glad you feel so for the farm in the east.  even
as a girl of four or five i was ever so glad to find the
farm.  in my eyes it was all as good as gold.  even my feet
felt good.  a girl can gain and grow fast on farm food and
the fine free air.  why else did face and form grow full
and fair so fast?
on each foot of my farm i felt free from fear.  it
gave me my fill of fun.  i felt no fear of any fire in the
fall.  now the fire is a fact and my farm is gone.  give me
my full life, etc.  the game goes on.
yours sincerely,
dear hal,
just a line to say i am lost if i cannot fly.  i
have to keep on here.  i knew it was but a hope last may.
it was just my last idea in june.  yet i held my head high
and did not lose hope.
why not fly up in the air a half hour or less and
look at my lake and our home on the hill?  i left it late
last july with one item on my list.  bill gave me half an
hour of help.  like the lady of the lake i met the king.
bill was a kind king, too.
to lead off into the air and see all our lake so
long and lots of land so low, was to live a high hour.  i
kept my hand at my ear so as to help hear.  in the air my
hair was a loss.  it did not kill me.  i have to fly to know
life can be less hard.  i like to hold on and help bill.  i
love to fly.
yours sincerely,

dear "pie,"
i open most of my mail and meet the news.  i note that
you say mrs. page is a mere name but you met the miss page.
you must need the car.  once the pass is open i can move
the car over to you.  do you mind if i make it part of a nice
plan to meet miss page, too?  mrs. page was only a mile past
us.  her son was my age and i made the mile at noon to play a
bit.  she paid us for milk.  she did not mean much to me, but
her son did.
next we had more fun up the pass near the poor old no.

it is a real rain.  the road is so soft my car can but
roll, stop, and roll on.  are you on the ship?  if i get as
far as the ship, can we sail in such a rain?  if we try to
sail, the ship is sure to rock or ride on one side.  if i get
sick, it is up to you to stay by and show us how to save the
ship.  ann has some sort of song to sing in the rain.  she
said she sent it to you.
did you read of our sale?  we set out a big sign.  now
any sort of suit and any size seem to sell.  we are not rich
but we can soon step out or be sold out, if any such rate is
to rule.
ann has not seen the ship as yet.  rain or no rain, ann
says to send her out.  all the rest of us say the same.  can
you ring me in my room at the shop?
yours sincerely,
the public is quite unfair about airing quibbles over
house furniture and fruit juices for the university crew.
the alumni inquiry into the failure of equipment figures in
the issue.  the alumni attitude is useful but continues to
put a premium on a victorious crew.  only genius can guide
this outfit uphill and build a suitable crew that won't quit.
students should be assisted in studying seated at their
desks; cross-questioned as to their needs and desires; ad-
vised to use up-to-date leads based on studies of standards.
by-products of student days, well-bred friends, kindness,
self-help, with good grades and degrees, are listed as far-
sighted aids.  in dad's old-fashioned address to his co-
workers, he said sadly that ideas are missed less than first-
class friends and good-natured wishers.

dear tris,
it is so very warm at this time of year, i told my wife
that you and i wish to go west for a week or two.  did i
tell you what a wind we had?  i went to town to vote for the
one man whom i want.  i took a well-used tire.  when it went
down on a bad turn, in the woods, i had to walk.  then the
wind more than set in, and i had to wait by a wall.  it got
our old tree.
i saw two men and set them to work on the car, till
they told me it was no use.  if i were to turn it in, is it
true that you can take your car?  i want a wide view and i
want to talk with you.  thus i wait upon your word.  wire
yes if you will take this trip.
yours sincerely,
dear "cab,"
could you apply to the court to allow my claim as agent
for mr. blank?  i could bring in his books and see about his
bills.  if asked, he can cover the costs by checks on a bank
that did not break.
will you allow your child to come alone to see me?  he
can have every apple he can carry.  by the way, being clean
and above board, you must be above bad cases, but you began
to bring in off-color cases after april.
i agree you do not cross the law, but why let men win
in a black cause on any basis?  why not build up your cases
from among men of our own class?  close the awful cases you
now carry along to court, and begin again.
sincerely yours,
in our motor party on the return trip an attractive
quartet first tried to tell thirty or forty short travel
stories.  by turns they transferred to the theater, to art
matters, to court trial stories.  in the latter a certain
doctor is hurt by a first truck, another truck is struck,
and three contractors are thrown to the street.  the girl's
strong brother has been hurt.  further, there are arrests
and the sort of extra details that enter into true stories.

dear fred,
i have dared to ask you for an extra favor on the first.
if you are not dated, i am to draft you to drive me by horse
or car up the grade to the field house at eight.  i guess you
have not heard fully about the great dance to be given by the
girls on the floor of the field house.
my hands have put fresh green goods on the walls.  every
girl has a green dress, on its front a funny glass heart that
she gives as a favor.  the old folks can drive up early, eat
and drink and enjoy it all.  we will delay the dance till the
girls enter in a dozen files.  it would crush me to death if
an error were found in the plans.  happy hours on earth are
never heavy.  can you doubt that you are going?
sincerely yours,
dear madam,
i have your two later notes of march 1.  maybe it is a
large order for you to leave for the north in the month of
march.
our place is miles away, but the real issue is that mu-
sic means much to us.  a night of music, even one piece of
music, has often meant more to me than my local paper and all
the power i have known.  if i can plant a love of music in all
parts of this place so that all who hear you sing can learn to
love it, it will mean more to me than money.
i never laugh at money, but isn't it plain in these
lines that price ought to be the least of all the items?  the
point is that our plans for your party are more important.  if
you read our other offer in the light of our love for music,
we might not seem so far away.
yours sincerely,
if truly quoted, you and guy, mere youths, fly a con-
tinuous journey of thousands of miles yearly in your study
of numerous flying routes.  you say you were south in july
in the dry country conspicuous for yucca, but now you are
busy buying a quota of various useful items to supply your
outfit for the famous yukon.  yet i am suspicious when you
say this unusual survey is monotonous rather than glorious.
you should hurry surely to vancouver for some delicious
yuletide fare.  it seems only yesterday that i was conscious
of being young and vigorous enough to fly my buoyant plane.
if you lucky boys are victorious over any unusually furious,
dangerous, or anxious double duty on this survey, write a
quotable account yourself for the journal.

dear alice,
i shall start my river story since you have shown you like
my style.
the scene is a state in the south.  a sweet girl speaks of
the sound and sight of the river.  seven men without shame raise
the stock sales and the boy tries to spend too much at the store.
in order to make a quiet and quick slide down the river, the men
seize the boat while the others, who are quite ready to serve the
girl, sleep.
it seems the girl has sense, for on a sheet of paper she
writes that her stock of gold is within reach from a round stone
under the small shade tree.  she does not quote the boy, but does
refer to the sorry end of his short study, and in her reply to his
folks she will state how the gold may still be spent in the right
way, which will stamp the story as real.
yours sincerely,
dear mrs. white,
i wish to thank you for the words you wrote three weeks ago,
and i trust you will write again on the wrong and waste of war.
as i watch the wheels of events today, i think you value a
thing it has taken me a third of my years to see.  in its total
trade the world is one whole, and each part in touch with the
other at most times.
the usual farm woman won't see a trade table or understand
its terms, for she is tired with her efforts to train and teach
her young.  she has tried to throw her value into her home, which
to her is worth so much.  war can not be put under until these
women see there is but one world, which truly is their world.
where will you be while the thick wheat is harvested?  if
not across the water, would you visit us, using your voice to
teach us these things?
yours sincerely,
important dinner company in our small apartment was
not common, and november ninth mamma was solemn in manner.
the moment nine american gentlemen were announced, fun and
argument began.  i remember one ancient gentleman, manager
of much more income than mine, who was not solemn as imag-
ined, but funny and human, even if normal demand, planned
movements of modern machines to canada, long term payments,
and columns of numbers meant much more to him than to me.

dear mr. and mrs. blank,
your son has not called on me.  if he is to become almost an
annual charge upon the county, the church will answer with action.
yet, i am afraid his arrest can not assure his coming around and
asking us for advice.  of course he has to appear before august.
he bought on credit, got behind in cash, and the amount became too
big.  i shall pay it.
you are an old couple, and i advise you to accept this.  any-
way, he is not a common boy and must have a chance.  he always does
appear to anyone as fit.  i run across copies of his art.  i can
advise your son, attend to his credit, and try to help him arrive
at a change for the better.

friday i didn't have cash, but a friend of the family had enough
for both of us.
father is having all the lot, except the garden, filled in
during the week.  giving in to his desire, i intend to work the
ground.  doctor says that my health is hardly an excuse, so i had
better decide to make an effort.  indeed, i am driven either to
finish the work in the near future or pay to have it done.
i am hoping you will happen upon some kindly fellow to whom
a flower garden itself is fun, and inform me.  i shall direct him,

i wonder if my sister talked to you on sunday of the
thirty things we wanted to do this summer?  we were trying
all the spring season at school to secure a supply of sim-
ple but strong materials for a camp in the valley.
it struck me as we were taking a walk down the street
that we would surely be unable to do as we stated unless you
took a sudden notion to help.  it seemed to me on second
thought we should give thanks to you for giving tongue to our
wishes last winter, for you turned the folks in our favor.
my sister was saying that girls from twenty states had
signed our pledge, so we are united.  though this is off the
subject, i saw a pretty yellow and silver dress within a win-
dow on main street toward our corner.  would you think it
suitable for the writer?

i acquired a bequest from a quizzical quaker.  how
to apply it was a quandary.  as a quasi artist, i began in
albuquerque to make a quantity of plaques of chance indian
acquaintances.  my masquerade as an artist of quality in
that quaint land of quite spanish art and adobe was adequate
and equally unique.  squeezed in quiet, antiquated adobe
quarters, i began quickly and without qualms to qualify as
an artist.  after quarrels and questions over my queer tech-

dear annabel,
my brother and his college friends in the factory decided to arrange an
evening exactly as in the old days.  after calling us, they arrived and we
carried out the idea.  we used an old college catalog and each girl had an
old college dress.
further to advance the evening, my brother advised us of an old address
near the freight yard where certain college boys brought this or that article
and were allowed a few dollars.  as we went in, an old man came a step farther,
fell forward and against me.  brother charged him.  will you believe this care-
ful account i enclose?  between brother and me lay this old man who did seem
dead.  i can't express my feeling.  his head was covered with marks of blows.
already we were anxious to go.  yet his safe was open, as if to furnish us
the old books with the many expense charges against the college boys.  when i
looked to see who of our company were in them, i read one balance after another
paid from the old country to my dearest son.  you are correct if you guess we
now ran, because we did.  what follows?  today's paper doesn't have a line.
yours sincerely,
dear mrs. white,
i have been holding on, but this january i am getting out.
my wife herself may have told you of our opening.  however, i go
at ten o'clock this morning, and your husband is still out.  he is
to do my general work himself, and may not imagine there is any
measure of justice in that.  we married men are obliged to do as
ordered.
i am leaving a hundred matters.  he has my opinion on each.
tell him the minutes of the last meeting of the members are on my
table.  tell him i haven't an invoice, but have instead an october
bill, for our new machine parts.  he may mention this item to the
manager, as he has neither its history nor my letters of inquiry.
i find nothing else to include.  we shall miss you greatly,
and we shall be looking for you at our new home.
yours sincerely,
dear patrick,
i realize that this letter i am sending may subject you to some trouble.
i am writing tonight without waiting to go through various reports on our

extra day, perhaps i would have come myself.
as soon as this letter has reached you, and you have finished reading the
several items about which i have written, i hope you can give extra working
time to my request for special records. these items will suggest a new plan as
i picture it.  i shall add them to this note.
it is my purpose to prepare a fast station-to-station service that should
be in running order soon.  i suppose it could be started next month.  let me
ask, also, whether we could receipt each payment, as we receive it, on a

dear nathan,
my last shipment has probably been received, for the purchase was made
thursday.  tomorrow is saturday, a pleasant day, for i go on my vacation.
do you remember an original idea you proposed last november relative
to planning for some shipping from my property?  my neighbor recently
called it a plan in a thousand, and we must get together so that i can
thank you properly.  this is a national as well as personal question,
and i am trusting that you will be thinking that it is possible for you to
help put it into practice.
if you can possibly separate yourself from teachers and your
teaching position sometime soon, plan to get a standard car and
whatever else is required for the trip.  the car would also be a
pleasure after you return to new york.  may i persuade you in re-
plying to state that you are planning to come promptly?  we will
make you one of the officers of the shipping business.
yours sincerely,
dear son,
i am beginning this afternoon to give my immediate attention
to a christmas that should be beautiful.  i have addressed, to be
forwarded and delivered in good condition, some new equipment
according to your wish.  i note, too, that your committee met.
what these gentlemen said is important and may be a sort of in-
surance that your plan does not fail.  i certainly would not want
to duplicate for you the kind of education given me.
be different by following more than one new idea, including
some of your own.  if you can carefully take fair advantage of
every available condition, everybody should accept you cordially,
as answering to the character of a gentleman.  mother is enclosing

dear gertrude,
this letter has no reference to shipments which you have
so kindly purchased from me in the past.  rather, as you are
returning to this territory by september, our president has re-
quested me as secretary to ask that you make a statement before
our club the first wednesday.
let me say something of the questions we have been receiving
for the year.  recently i read that the old principle today still
applies.  it is wonderful what our new knowledge has surprised us
into regarding as necessary for ourselves--sometimes things not
even mentioned yesterday.
will you therefore represent this new deal and present the
situation to us in principle, sincerely, as you see it?  other-
wise, if you cannot make this provision now, i shall be glad to
call upon you later.
yours sincerely,
dear alex,
we are especially interested in the settlement run by a
new department at the university.  we appreciate the importance
of its additional study to understand impossible conditions in
the poor parts of our city, and its use for adjustment of some
particular boy or girl.  have you read our memorandum in this
connection?
our city is absolutely too big.  with the automobile we can
distribute every person to his home along a line, our wide road,
run far out from the city.  the difference between country and
city grows less and less, in accordance with such use of the auto-
mobile.
concerning our collection of any remittance from you, this
would serve to form a conference which would develop everything
that can make city governments bring full and rich experience
to all.
sincerely yours,
dear sir,
i wish to acknowledge the recent interesting correspondence
from your office on the very considerable requirements of the new
law that have to do with any unfortunate advertising that might
appear in my papers.
our association also has appreciated both your instructions
and the opportunity for prompt examination and understanding of
the new arrangement, particularly its application to all informa-
tion given the public about merchandise for sale.  this has been
a real convenience in our consideration of the entire proposition.
i want to assure you that our co-operation under the new law
will be satisfactory in every way.
yours respectfully,
the journal learned that the relatives on their arrival in
april had already referred the trouble to lawyers.  their early re-
turn surprises me.  as to the children themselves, the older girls
are personally agreeable, slender, and certainly full of zest.  they
travel yearly and already are familiar with the world.  their father
was a quizzical old man who fairly idolized them.  his will leaves
them very nearly a half-million dollars.  only the earlier, first
will is very irregular.  i've already quizzed them about the real
hazards of quarrels over legal prizes of similar size.  from their
replies i've realized slowly that the girls are all right.  it
really amazes me that even persons like ourselves promptly seize
upon some hostile relative's version of an earlier will, which
should be recognized easily as false.
